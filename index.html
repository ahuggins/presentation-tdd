# Test Driven Development
### What's the big stink?
---
layout: false

The idea that you test your code with automated tests, that allow you to have confidence in your code by testing at the unit level or functional tests.

## How many people currently do TDD?

template: inverse
### Unless you write all your code and deploy immediately...you are testing.

### The Promise
1. Code Confidence
1. Cleaner Code
1. Faster Development
1. Worry-free weekends 

---
### The Reality
1. I believe it does help in code confidence
    * However, your test may not account for each edge case and will pass, but doesn't mean it's 100%
1. I think it does help in cleaner code, because you have to write code in a way that's testable. Often this keeps things a little simpler.
1. I think it would help with development times
    * But you have to compare time of writing tests and development with standard approach of development, troubleshooting and bug fixes.
    * I think TDD helps to reduce troubleshooting and likelihood of bugs.
1. If your tests are passing, then your weekend should be uninterrupted.

> Warning! Testing is a possible solution to these common development problems, but it isn't going to solve everything. It's a tool, not the path of enlightenment.

### Testing Frameworks in PHP

1. PHPUnit - [https://phpunit.de/](https://phpunit.de/)
1. PHPSpec - [http://www.phpspec.net/en/latest/](http://www.phpspec.net/en/latest/)
1. Behat - [http://docs.behat.org/en/v3.0/](http://docs.behat.org/en/v3.0/)
1. Codeception - [http://codeception.com/](http://codeception.com/)
1. There are others, but these are the big ones.

### Mocking in PHP
1. PHPUnit, has built in mocking
1. Mockery - [http://docs.mockery.io/en/latest/](http://docs.mockery.io/en/latest/)
1. Phake - [http://phake.readthedocs.io/en/2.1/](http://phake.readthedocs.io/en/2.1/)

Sometimes in testing, a package may be difficult to setup in order to use it in testing; or you don't want to rely on external dependencies. Mocking allows you to fake an object, and fake a method call and return values that you know an object should return.

Mocking is a little tricky to really wrap your head around what it is, and when you should actually do it. To be honest, I can't really say that I am an expert on mocking, but it is a technique that you should be aware of when testing.
